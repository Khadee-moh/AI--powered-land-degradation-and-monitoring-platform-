📖 Overview

The AI-Powered Land Degradation and Monitoring Platform is an innovative software solution designed to help farmers, researchers, and policymakers monitor soil health, track land use changes, and prevent land degradation through machine learning and satellite data analysis.

This platform bridges the gap between agricultural sustainability and technology, empowering subsistence and commercial farmers with data-driven insights to improve productivity while preserving the environment — directly contributing to UN SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

🧭 Problem Statement

Across many developing regions, particularly in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa, farmers face:

Rapid land degradation due to deforestation, overgrazing, and unsustainable fertilizer use.

Poor soil fertility monitoring, leading to reduced yields and hunger.

Unsafe chemical practices — premature fruit ripening and heavy pesticide use endanger human health and biodiversity.

Lack of reliable seasonal data to plan for planting, harvesting, and soil restoration.

This project aims to tackle these issues through AI-driven insights that inform smarter, safer, and more sustainable land use.
